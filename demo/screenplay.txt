\summary{The two characters are on their way to the Lighthouse.}

\dir{Black. The rumble of a lonely foghorn. Low. Faint.}
\dir{Then a wide shot at a boat.}

Fog. Nothing else in sight. Slowly, a steam boat emerges.
OLD and YOUNG are on the deck. They are looking right in front of them, where a lonely light emerges from the fog. The foghorn's noise is louder now.

<The previous screenplay comes from one of my favorite movie: The Lighthouse (dir. Robert Eggers) : https://letterboxd.com/film/the-lighthouse-2019/>
