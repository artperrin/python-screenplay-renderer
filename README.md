# Python screenplay renderer

The aim of this project is to create a simple document parser in Python, to render movie screenplays as a pdf file. Nothing fancy, just a nice cover page and the script.

I intent the screenplay's file to follow a LaTex-like syntax, and to be coupled with a metadata file (containing the project's title, the writers' names, director's name, _et cetera_).

The Python program ought to be simple and to work with few external libraries.
